/** 
 * This interface is implemented by objects that visit resource trees.  The fast
 * visitor is an optimized mechanism for tree traversal that creates a minimal
 * number of objects.  The visitor is provided with a callback interface,
 * instead of a resource.  Through the callback, the visitor can request
 * information about the resource being visited.
 * <p> 
 * Usage:
 * <pre>
 * class Visitor implements IResourceProxyVisitor { 	
 * 	public boolean visit (IResourceProxy proxy) { 
 * 		//	 your code here 
 * 		return true;  
 * 	} 
 * } 
 * ResourcesPlugin.getWorkspace().getRoot().accept(new Visitor(), IResource.NONE);
 * </pre>
 * </p> 
 * <p>
 * Clients may implement this interface.

/**
 * A lightweight interface for requesting information about a resource.
 * All of the "get" methods on a resource proxy have trivial performance cost. 
 * Requesting the full path or the actual resource handle will cause extra objects 
 * to be created and will thus have greater cost.
 * <p>
 * When a resource proxy is used within an {@link IResourceProxyVisitor},
 * it is a transient object that is only valid for the duration of a single visit method.  
 * A proxy should not be referenced once the single resource visit is complete. 
 * The equals and hashCode methods should not be relied on.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A proxy can also be created using {@link IResource#createProxy()}. In
 * this case the proxy is valid indefinitely, but will not remain in sync with
 * the state of the corresponding resource.
 * </p>
